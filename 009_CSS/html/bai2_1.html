        <p>In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine that would help him get around the royal gardens faster:
            two
            same-size in-line wheels, the front one steerable, mounted in a frame upon which u straddled. The device was
            propelled by pushing your feet against the ground, thus rolling yourself and the device forward in a sort of
            gliding
            walk.</p>
