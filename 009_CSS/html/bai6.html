                    <span>In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine that would help him get around the royal gardens faster:
                        two
                        same-size in-line wheels, the front one steerable, mounted in a frame upon which u straddled. The device was
                        propelled by pushing your feet against the ground, thus rolling yourself and the device forward in a sort of
                        gliding
                        walk.
